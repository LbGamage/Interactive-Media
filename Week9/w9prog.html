      <p>In order to keep my styling consistent even when making the webpages responsive I made custom buttons, text box
        borders for each stage.</p>

      <img src="images/Screenshot 2025-05-15 223133.png">
      <p>I struggled a lot with making text stay inside the borders when resizing the windows. This stage took a lot of
        trial and error. I used media queries when making the website responsive. Due to time constraints I only focused
        on making 2C responsive.</p>

      <p> I was trying to have some simple interactivity in my 2C workbook since the main focus was Physical computing.
        I did that through the use of CSS, sound and simple animations. Week-7-8 was tamagotchi themed so I tried to
        make the aesthetic of the pages match a tamagotchi display.</p>

      <p>As mentioned before, positioning text and stacking divs took most of the time as I wanted to make it as
        responsive as possible and wanted to avoid the pages breaking. This also helped me understand how to use CSS
        styling more effectively.</p>

      <p>In order to help me position divs and other items accurately I gave each one a background-colour which helped a
        lot in understanding what was going wrong where</p>
