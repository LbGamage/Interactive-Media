        <p>In order to keep my styling consitent even when making the webpages resposive I made custom buttons, text box boarders for each stage.</p>

      <p>I stuggrled a lot with making text stay inside the borders when resized the windows. This stage took a lot of trial and error. I used media queries when making the website responsive. Due to time constraints I only focused on making 2C responsive.</p>

      <p>Positioning text and images to be in the right spot when the screen size changes took more time than expected. </p>

      <p> I was tyrying to have some simple interactivity in my 2C workbook since the main focus was Physical computing. I did that through the use of CSS, sound and simple animations. Week-7-8 was tamagotchi themed so I tried to make the aesthetic of the pages match a tamagotchi display</p>

    <p>As mentioned before postioning text and stacking divs took most of the time as I wanted to make it was responsive as possible and wanted to avoid the pages breaking. This also helped me understand how to use CSS styling more effectively</p>

    <p>In order to help me postion divs and other items accurately I gave eacg on a background-color which helped a lot in understanding what was going wrong where</p>
