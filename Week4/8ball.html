        We were doing the "Slave to the Algorithm" exercises where randomness influenced how we went through our day. I lowkey already live like that because I love letting "the universe take the wheel" sometimes, especially as a very indecisve person. Honestly, it didnâ€™t mess up my day much, but I had fun with it.
      <ul>
        <li>if (walkLight === 'green') {<br>
            walkHome();<br>
          } else if (walkLight === 'red') {<br>
            takeTramHome();<br>
          } <br>Ended up turning green and I walked 10K+ steps to get home</li>
          <li>Asked my friend to choose 1 or 2. If 1 I would go home and study. If 2 I would go to the park and read for a bit. Ended up going to the park to read
        </li>
        <li>
          Spun a wheel to decide how to cook chicken. We ended up making teriyaki chicken.
        </li>
        <li>//Flipped a coin to choose what to drink. I got an orange juice.<br>
            let drink = (coin === 'heads') ? 'matcha' : 'orange juice';</li>
        
        <li>If someone got on the elevator while I was going up, Iâ€™d head to the library to study. Otherwise, Iâ€™d stay in my room. No one did, so I studied from bed ðŸ˜Œ (Which is why I was tempted to nap.)</li>
        <li> Asked the 8ball if I could take a nap. It said no. Thugged through the day without a nap like a champ
          </li>
        <li>If I bumped into someone I knew in the city, Iâ€™d order out. Otherwise, Iâ€™d just eat at home. Honestly didnâ€™t think it would happen, felt way too random. But Jurgen ran into me at the tram stop while he was doing his own slave to the algoritms thing. Got Rollâ€™d ðŸ˜„.</li>

        <li>Asked the magic 8 ball and changed my bedsheets instead of doing it during the weekend like I usually would.</li>
        <li>Flipped a coin at the gym to decide whether to do arms or legs. Did arms and now I can't lift them</li>
        <li>Asked my friend to choose a number between 1-10. Odd means I'd go to bed. Even meant I'd play a video game (stardew valley) before bed. She picked 6 so I ended up playing till 1 am (oops)</li>
