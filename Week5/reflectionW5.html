            ୨୧ Week 5 was when I really started to explore P5.js properly. In Week 4 we had a basic introduction, and this week built on that with a focus on working with images and video. We learned how to use the webcam and apply filters to it, which I found really fun. I also tried to learn about face mapping and wanted to create my own filter, but with the time constraints alonge with the fact I was still getting the hang of P5, I wasn’t able to pull it off. Still, I came across some really cool ones online that inspired me.<br><br>

            As I mentioned before, I kept making silly mistakes like missing commas or random typos, so I ended up setting up P5.js in VS Code. Honestly, it made everything so much easier and smoother to work with.<br><br>
            
            After that, I watched The Coding Train’s beginner tutorials on P5.js, which helped a lot. I kept experimenting with what I’d started in Weeks 4 and 5, and while digging around the P5.js site, I stumbled across the 3D and WEBGL features. I played around with those too and had loads of fun—definitely something I want to explore more.<br><br>
            
            For this week’s theme, I went with a very coquette pink aesthetic and tried to mimic a Mac-style UI (funny enough, I’m a Windows user through and through). It was one of the themes on my pinboard (homepage), so I thought it’d be fun to bring it to life.<br><br>

            The more I work on my workbook the clearer my vision for it is becoming, its a process.<br><br>
