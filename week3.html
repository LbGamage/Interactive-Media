        <p>In Week 2, we took a journey through the different versions of the WWW: Web 1.0, the static web; Web 2.0, the social web; and Web 3.0, the 3D decentralized web. We also explored various types of websites. During the worksho we did some Paper Prototyping, trying out Crazy 8s and creating wireframesf for our workbook. Along with that we got into the basics of CSS, covering layout, units, fonts, and more!</p>
